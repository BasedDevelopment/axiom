# ðŸ¦Š vixen

Vixen is a web interface for eve. It is written in Svelte and provides a interface for controlling virtual machines and viewing their statistics.

Vixen was primarily designed for [EricNet](https://as206628.net), however I still wish to make it as self-hostable as possible. I know the provided documentation and instructions are not great, so if you have any questions please email me: <lukewhrit@proton.me>.
